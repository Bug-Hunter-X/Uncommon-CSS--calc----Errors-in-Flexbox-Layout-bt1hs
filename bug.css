The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox container might not behave as expected if the container's width is not explicitly defined or is affected by other properties like `min-width` or `max-width`. Another common error is forgetting the space between operators in `calc()` expressions, like `calc(100%-10px)` instead of `calc(100% - 10px).` Units must also be consistent; mixing pixels and percentages without careful consideration can lead to unpredictable results.
